\item 
If we can find a vector $\vect{w_1}$ that is a linear combination of $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$, then $\spn{\vect{u}, \vect{v}, \vect{w}_1}$ will be the same set as $\spn{\vect{u}, \vect{v}}$.  Thus, $\vect{w}_1$ can be any linear combination of $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$.  One such example is 
$\vect{w}_1 = 3\vect{u} - \vect{v} = \colvector{1\\11\\-7}$.

\item 
Now we are looking for a vector $\vect{w}_2$ that cannot be written as a linear combination of $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$. How can we find such a vector?  Any vector that matches two components but not the third of any element of $\spn{\vect{u}, \vect{v}}$ will not be in the span (why?).  One such example is 
$\vect{w}_2 = \colvector{4\\-4\\1}$ 
(which is nearly $2\vect{v}$, but not quite).
