    <title>Nonsingular Matrices</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>In this section we specialize further and consider matrices with equal numbers of rows and columns, which when considered as coefficient matrices lead to systems with equal numbers of equations and variables.  We will see in the second half of the course (<xref ref="chapter-D" acro="D"/>, <xref ref="chapter-E" acro="E"/>, <xref ref="chapter-LT" acro="LT"/>, <xref ref="chapter-R" acro="R"/>) that these matrices are especially important.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsection-NM-NM" acro="NM">
        <title>Nonsingular Matrices</title>
        <p>Our theorems will now establish connections between systems of equations (homogeneous or otherwise), augmented matrices representing those systems, coefficient matrices, constant vectors, the reduced row-echelon form of matrices (augmented and coefficient) and solution sets.  Be very careful in your reading, writing and speaking about systems of equations, matrices and sets of vectors.  A system of equations is not a matrix, a matrix is not a solution set, and a solution set is not a system of equations.  Now would be a great time to review the discussion about speaking and writing mathematics in Proof Technique<nbsp/><xref ref="technique-L" acro="L" text="global"/>.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>A matrix with <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns is <term>square</term> if <m>m=n</m>.  In this case, we say the matrix has <term>size</term> <m>n</m>.  To emphasize the situation when a matrix is not square, we will call it <term>rectangular</term>.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>We can now present one of the central definitions of linear algebra.</p>

                <h>matrix</h>
                <h>nonsingular</h>
            </idx>
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose <m>A</m> is a square matrix.  Suppose further that the solution set to the homogeneous linear system of equations <m>\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}</m> is <m>\set{\zerovector}</m>, in other words, the system has <em>only</em> the trivial solution.  Then we say that <m>A</m> is a <term>nonsingular</term> matrix.  Otherwise we say <m>A</m> is a <term>singular</term> matrix.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>We can investigate whether any square matrix is nonsingular or not, no matter if the matrix is derived somehow from a system of equations or if it is simply a matrix.  The definition says that to perform this investigation we must construct a very specific system of equations (homogeneous, with the matrix as the coefficient matrix) and look at its solution set.  We will have theorems in this section that connect nonsingular matrices with systems of equations, creating more opportunities for confusion.  Convince yourself now of two observations, (1) we can decide nonsingularity for any square matrix, and (2) the determination of nonsingularity involves the solution set for a certain homogeneous system of equations.</p>
        <p>Notice that it makes no sense to call a system of equations nonsingular (the term does not apply to a system of equations), nor does it make any sense to call a <m>5\times 7</m> matrix singular (the matrix is not square).</p>

            <p>Being nonsingular is an important matrix property, and in such cases Sage contains commands that quickly and easily determine if the mathematical object does, or does not, have the property.  The names of these types of methods universally begin with <c>.is_</c>, and these might be referred to as <q>predicates</q> or <q>queries.</q>.  In the Sage notebook, define a simple matrix <c>A</c>, and then in a cell type <c>A.is_</c>, followed by pressing the <c>TAB</c> key rather than evaluating the cell.  You will get a list of numerous properties that you can investigate for the matrix <c>A</c>.  (Tab-completion will not work as advertised with the Sage Cell server.)</p>
            <p>The other convention is to name these properties in a positive way, so the relevant command for nonsingular matrices is <c>.is_singular()</c>.  We will redo <xref ref="example-S" acro="S"/> and <xref ref="example-NM" acro="NM"/>.  Note the use of <c>not</c> in the last compute cell.</p>

            <p>It is straightforward to create an identity matrix in Sage.  Just specify the number system and the number of rows (which will equal the number of columns, so you do not specify that since it would be redundant).  The number system can be left out, but the result will have entries from the integers (<c>ZZ</c>), which in this course is unlikely to be what you really want.</p>

For these reasons we call the <c>identity_matrix()</c> function a <term>constructor</term>, since it builds something from scratch, in this case a very particular type of matrix.</p>
            <p>We mentioned above that an identity matrix is in reduced row-echelon form.  What happens if we try to row-reduce a matrix that is already in reduced row-echelon form?  By the uniqueness of the result, there should be no change.  The following code illustrates this.  Notice that <c>=</c> is used to <em>assign</em> an object to a new name, while <c>==</c> is used to <em>test equality</em> of two objects.  I frequently make the mistake of forgetting the second equal sign when I mean to test equality.</p>

When the augmented matrix <m>\augmented{A}{\zerovector}</m> is row-reduced, the result is <m>\augmented{B}{\zerovector}=\augmented{I_n}{\zerovector}</m>.  The number of nonzero rows is equal to the number of variables in the linear system of equations <m>\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}</m>, so <m>n=r</m> and <xref ref="theorem-FVCS" acro="FVCS"/> gives <m>n-r=0</m> free variables.

                <p>Suppose that <m>A</m> is a square matrix.  Then <m>A</m> is nonsingular if and only if the null space of <m>A</m> is the set containing only the zero vector, <ie/> <m>\nsp{A}=\set{\zerovector}</m>.</p>

                <p>The null space of a square <em>matrix</em>, <m>A</m>, is equal to the set of solutions to the homogeneous <em>system</em>, <m>\homosystem{A}</m>.  A <em>matrix</em> is nonsingular if and only if the set of solutions to the homogeneous <em>system</em>, <m>\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}</m>, has only a trivial solution.

            </statement>
            <proof>
                <case direction="backward">
                    <p>The hypothesis for this half of the proof is that the system <m>\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}</m> has a unique solution for <em>every</em> choice of the constant vector <m>\vect{b}</m>.  We will make a very specific choice for <m>\vect{b}</m>:  <m>\vect{b}=\zerovector</m>.  Then we know that the system <m>\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}</m> has a unique solution.  But this is precisely the definition of what it means for <m>A</m> to be nonsingular (<xref ref="definition-NM" acro="NM"/>).  That almost seems too easy!  Notice that we have not used the full power of our hypothesis, but there is nothing that says we must use a hypothesis to its fullest.</p>
                <case direction="forward">
                </case>
                    <p>We assume that <m>A</m> is nonsingular of size <m>n\times n</m>, so we know there is a sequence of row operations that will convert <m>A</m> into the identity matrix <m>I_n</m> (<xref ref="theorem-NMRRI" acro="NMRRI"/>).  Form the augmented matrix <m>A^\prime=\augmented{A}{\vect{b}}</m> and apply this same sequence of row operations to <m>A^\prime</m>.  The result will be the matrix <m>B^\prime=\augmented{I_n}{\vect{c}}</m>, which is in reduced row-echelon form with <m>r=n</m>.  Then the augmented matrix <m>B^\prime</m> represents the (extremely simple) system of equations <m>x_i=\vectorentry{\vect{c}}{i}</m>, <m>1\leq i\leq n</m>.  The vector <m>\vect{c}</m> is clearly a solution, so the system is consistent (<xref ref="definition-CS" acro="CS"/>).  With a consistent system, we use <xref ref="theorem-FVCS" acro="FVCS"/> to count free variables.  We find that there are <m>n-r=n-n=0</m> free variables, and so we therefore know that the solution is unique.  (This half of the proof was suggested by Asa Scherer.)</p>
                </case>
            </proof>
        </theorem>
        <p>This theorem helps to explain part of our interest in nonsingular matrices.  If a matrix is nonsingular, then no matter what vector of constants we pair it with, using the matrix as the  coefficient matrix will <em>always</em> yield a linear system of equations with a solution, and the solution is unique.  To determine if a matrix has this property (nonsingularity) it is enough to just solve one linear system, the homogeneous system with the matrix as coefficient matrix and the zero vector as the vector of constants (or any other vector of constants, see <xref ref="exercise-MM-T10" acro="MM.T10"/>).</p>
        <p>Formulating the negation of the second part of this theorem is a good exercise.  A singular matrix has the property that for <em>some</em> value of the vector <m>\vect{b}</m>, the system <m>\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}</m> does not have a unique solution (which means that it has no solution or infinitely many solutions).  We will be able to say more about this case later (see the discussion following <xref ref="theorem-PSPHS" acro="PSPHS"/>).</p>
        <p>Square matrices that are nonsingular have a long list of interesting properties, which we will start to catalog in the following, recurring, theorem.  Of course, singular matrices will then have all of the opposite properties.  The following theorem is a list of equivalences.</p>
        <p>We want to understand just what is involved with understanding and proving a theorem that says several conditions are equivalent. So have a look at Proof Technique<nbsp/><xref ref="technique-ME" acro="ME" text="global"/> before studying the first in this series of theorems.</p>

            <p>Sage will create random matrices and vectors, sometimes with various properties.  These can be very useful for quick experiments, and they are also useful for <em>illustrating</em> that theorems hold for any object satisfying the hypotheses of the theorem.  But this will never replace a proof.</p>
            <p>We will illustrate <xref ref="theorem-NME1" acro="NME1"/> using Sage.  We will use a variant of the <c>random_matrix()</c> constructor that uses the <c>algorithm='unimodular'</c> keyword.  We will have to wait for <xref ref="chapter-D" acro="D"/> before we can give a full explanation, but for now, understand that this command will <em>always</em> create a square matrix that is nonsingular.  Also realize that there are square nonsingular matrices which will never be the output of this command.  In other words, this command creates elements of just a subset of all possible nonsingular matrices.</p>
            <p>So we are using random matrices below to illustrate properties predicted by <xref ref="theorem-NME1" acro="NME1"/>.  Execute the first command to create a random nonsingular matrix, and notice that we only have to mark the output of <c>A</c> as random for our automated testing process.  After a few runs, notice that you can also edit the value of <c>n</c> to create matrices of different sizes.  With a matrix <c>A</c> defined, run the next three cells, which by <xref ref="theorem-NME1" acro="NME1"/> each always produce <c>True</c> as their output, <em>no matter what value</em> <c>A</c> <em>has</em>, so long as <c>A</c> is nonsingular.  Read the code and try to determine exactly how they correspond to the parts of the theorem (some commentary along these lines follows).</p>

            <p>The only portion of these commands that may be unfamilar is the last one.  The command <c>range(n)</c> is incredibly useful, as it will create a list of the integers from <c>0</c> up to, <em>but not including</em>, <c>n</c>.  (We saw this command briefly in Sage<nbsp/><xref ref="sage-FDV" acro="FDV" text="global"/>.)  So, for example, <c>range(3) == [0,1,2]</c> is <c>True</c>.  Pivots are returned as a <q>tuple</q> which is very much like a list, except we cannot change the contents.  We can see the difference by the way the tuple prints with parentheses (<c>(,)</c>) rather than brackets (<c>[,]</c>).  We can convert a list to a tuple with the <c>tuple()</c> command, in order to make the comparison succeed.</p>
            <p>How do we tell if the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of equations represents a system with a unique solution?  First, the system must be consistent, which by <xref ref="theorem-RCLS" acro="RCLS"/> means the last column is not a pivot column.  Then with a consistent system we need to insure there are no free variables.  This happens if and only if the remaining columns are all pivot columns, according to <xref ref="theorem-FVCS" acro="FVCS"/>, thus the test used in the last compute cell.</p>
        </computation>
        <p>Finally, you may have wondered why we refer to a matrix as <em>nonsingular</em> when it creates systems of equations with <em>single</em> solutions (<xref ref="theorem-NMUS" acro="NMUS"/>)!  I have wondered the same thing.  We will have an opportunity to address this just before <xref ref="theorem-NPNF" acro="NPNF" />, and again when we get to <xref ref="theorem-SMZD" acro="SMZD"/>.  Can you wait that long?</p>

Since <m>A</m> is nonsingular, we must conclude that this solution is the trivial solution, and so <m>0=d_j-e_j</m>, <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>.  That is, <m>d_j=e_j</m> for all <m>j</m> and the two solutions are identical, meaning any solution to <m>(*)</m> is unique.</p> <p> Notice that the proposed solution (<m>x_i=\frac{c_i}{c_{n+1}}</m>) appeared in this proof with no motivation whatsoever.  This is just fine in a proof.  A proof should <em>convince</em> you that a theorem is <em>true</em>.  It is your job to <em>read</em> the proof and be convinced of every assertion.  Questions like <q>Where did that come from?</q> or <q>How would I think of that?</q> have no bearing on the <em>validity</em> of the proof.</p>
