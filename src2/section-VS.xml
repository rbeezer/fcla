    <title>Vector Spaces</title>

        <p>In this section we present a formal definition of a vector space, which will lead to an extra increment of abstraction.  Once defined, we study its most basic properties.</p>

                <p>Suppose that <m>V</m> is a set upon which we have defined two operations: (1) <term>vector addition</term>, which combines two elements of <m>V</m> and is denoted by <q>+</q>, and (2) <term>scalar multiplication</term>, which combines a complex number with an element of <m>V</m> and is denoted by juxtaposition.   Then <m>V</m>, along with the two operations, is a <term>vector space</term> over <m>\complexes</m> if the following ten properties hold.<dl>

                <p>The objects in <m>V</m> are called <term>vectors</term>, no matter what else they might really be, simply by virtue of being elements of a vector space.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>Now, there are several important observations to make.  Many of these will be easier to understand on a second or third reading, and especially after carefully studying the examples in <xref ref="subsection-VS-EVS" acro="VS.EVS"/>.</p>
        <p>An <term>axiom</term> is often a <q>self-evident</q> truth.  Something so fundamental that we all agree it is true and accept it without proof.  Typically, it would be the logical underpinning that we would begin to build theorems upon.  Some might refer to the ten properties of <xref ref="definition-VS" acro="VS"/> as axioms, implying that a vector space is a very natural object and the ten properties are the essence of a vector space.  We will instead emphasize that we will begin with a definition of a vector space.   After studying the remainder of this chapter, you might return here and remind yourself how all our forthcoming theorems and definitions rest on this foundation.</p>
        <p>As we will see shortly, the objects in <m>V</m> can be <em>anything</em>, even though we will call them vectors.  We have been working with vectors frequently, but we should stress here that these have so far just been <em>column</em> vectors <mdash/> scalars arranged in a columnar list of fixed length.  In a similar vein, you have used the symbol <q>+</q> for many years to represent the addition of numbers (scalars).  We have extended its use to the addition of column vectors and to the addition of matrices, and now we are going to recycle it even further and let it denote vector addition in <em>any</em> possible vector space.  So when describing a new vector space, we will have to <em>define</em> exactly what <q>+</q> is.  Similar comments apply to scalar multiplication.  Conversely, we can <em>define</em> our operations any way we like, so long as the ten properties are fulfilled (see <xref ref="example-CVS" acro="CVS"/>).</p>
        <!-- Removed 2013/11/07: (see <acroref type="section" acro="F" /> for more on these objects) -->
        <p>In <xref ref="definition-VS" acro="VS"/>, the scalars do not have to be complex numbers.  They can come from what are called in more advanced mathematics, <q>fields</q>.  Examples of fields are the set of complex numbers, the set of real numbers, the set of rational numbers, and even the finite set of <q>binary numbers</q>, <m>\set{0,\,1}</m>.  There are many, many others.  In this case we would call <m>V</m> a <term>vector space</term> over (the field) <m>F</m>.</p>
        <p>A vector space is composed of three objects, a set and two operations.  Some would explicitly state in the definition that <m>V</m> must be a nonempty set, but we can infer this from <xref ref="property-Z" acro="Z"/>, since the set cannot be empty and contain a vector that behaves as the zero vector.  Also, we usually use the same symbol for both the set and the vector space itself.  Do not let this convenience fool you into thinking the operations are secondary!</p>
        <p>This discussion has either convinced you that we are really embarking on a new level of abstraction, or it has seemed cryptic, mysterious or nonsensical.  You might want to return to this section in a few days and give it another read then.  In any case, let us look at some concrete examples now.</p>

        <title>Examples of Vector Spaces</title>
        <p>Our aim in this subsection is to give you a storehouse of examples to work with, to become comfortable with the ten vector space properties and to convince you that the multitude of examples justifies (at least initially) making such a broad definition as <xref ref="definition-VS" acro="VS"/>.  Some of our claims will be justified by reference to previous theorems, we will prove some facts from scratch, and we will do one nontrivial example completely.  In other places, our usual thoroughness will be neglected, so grab paper and pencil and play along.</p>

            </dl>Does this set with these operations fulfill the ten properties?  Yes.  And all we need to do is quote <xref ref="theorem-VSPM" acro="VSPM"/>.  Another easy one (by design).</p>
        </example>
        <p>So, the set of all matrices of a fixed size forms a vector space.  That entitles us to call a matrix a vector, since a matrix is an element of a vector space.  For example, if <m>A,\,B\in M_{34}</m> then we call <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> <q>vectors,</q> and we even use our previous notation for column vectors to refer to <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.  So we could legitimately write expressions like<me>\vect{u}+\vect{v}=A+B=B+A=\vect{v}+\vect{u}</me>This could lead to some confusion, but it is not too great a danger.  But it is worth comment.</p>
        <p>The previous two examples may be less than satisfying.  We made all the relevant definitions long ago.  And the required verifications were all handled by quoting old theorems.  However, it is important to consider these two examples first.  We have been studying vectors and matrices carefully (<xref ref="chapter-V" acro="V"/>, <xref ref="chapter-M" acro="M"/>), and both objects, along with their operations, have certain properties in common, as you may have noticed in comparing <xref ref="theorem-VSPCV" acro="VSPCV"/> with <xref ref="theorem-VSPM" acro="VSPM"/>.  Indeed, it is these two theorems that <em>motivate</em> us to formulate the abstract definition of a vector space, <xref ref="definition-VS" acro="VS"/>.  Now, if we prove some general theorems about vector spaces (as we will shortly in <xref ref="subsection-VS-VSP" acro="VS.VSP"/>), we can then instantly apply the conclusions to <em>both</em> <m>\complex{m}</m> and <m>M_{mn}</m>.  Notice too, how we have taken eight definitions and two theorems and reduced them down to two <em>examples</em>.  With greater generalization and abstraction our old ideas get downgraded in stature.</p>
        <p>Let us look at some more examples, now considering some new vector spaces.</p>

                </li>
            </dl>This set, with these operations, will fulfill the ten properties, though we will not work all the details here.  However, we will make a few comments and prove one of the properties.  First, the zero vector (<xref ref="property-Z" acro="Z"/>) is what you might expect, and you can check that it has the required property.<me>\zerovector=0+0x+0x^2+\cdots+0x^n</me></p>
            <p>The additive inverse (<xref ref="property-AI" acro="AI"/>) is also no surprise, though consider how we have chosen to write it.<me>-\left(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_nx^n\right)=(-a_0)+(-a_1)x+(-a_2)x^2+\cdots+(-a_n)x^n</me></p>
            <p>Now let us prove the associativity of vector addition (<xref ref="property-AA" acro="AA"/>).  This is a bit tedious, though necessary.  Throughout, the plus sign (<q>+</q>) does triple-duty.  You might ask yourself what each plus sign represents as you work through this proof.<md>

            <p>Notice how it is the application of the associativity of the (old) addition of complex numbers in the middle of this chain of equalities that makes the whole proof happen.  The remainder is successive applications of our (new) definition of vector (polynomial) addition.  Proving the remainder of the ten properties is similar in style and tedium.  You might try proving the commutativity of vector addition (<xref ref="property-C" acro="C"/>), or one of the distributivity properties (<xref ref="property-DVA" acro="DVA"/>, <xref ref="property-DSA" acro="DSA"/>).</p>

You might have studied functions of one variable that take a real number to a real number, and that might be a more natural set to use as <m>X</m>.  But since we are allowing our scalars to be complex numbers, we need to specify that the range of our functions is the complex numbers.  Study carefully how the definitions of the operation are made, and think about the different uses of <q>+</q> and juxtaposition.  As an example of what is required when verifying that this is a vector space, consider that  the zero vector (<xref ref="property-Z" acro="Z"/>) is the function <m>z</m> whose definition is <m>z(x)=0</m> for every input <m>x\in X</m>.</p>
            <p>Vector spaces of functions are very important in mathematics and physics, where the field of scalars may be the real numbers, so the ranges of the functions can in turn also be the set of real numbers.</p>

        <title>Vector Space Properties</title>
        <p><xref ref="subsection-VS-EVS" acro="VS.EVS"/> has provided us with an abundance of examples of vector spaces, most of them containing useful and interesting mathematical objects along with natural operations.  In this subsection we will prove some general properties of vector spaces.  Some of these results will again seem obvious, but it is important to understand why it is necessary to state and prove them.  A typical hypothesis will be <q>Let <m>V</m> be a vector space.</q>  From this we may assume the ten properties of <xref ref="definition-VS" acro="VS"/>, <em>and nothing more</em>.  It is like starting over, as we learn about what can happen in this new algebra we are learning.  But the power of this careful approach is that we can apply these theorems to any vector space we encounter <mdash/> those in the previous examples, or new ones we have not yet contemplated.  Or perhaps new ones that nobody has ever contemplated.  We will illustrate some of these results with examples from the crazy vector space (<xref ref="example-CVS" acro="CVS"/>), but mostly we are stating theorems and doing proofs.  These proofs do not get too involved, but are not trivial either, so these are good theorems to try proving yourself before you study the proof given here.  (See Proof Technique<nbsp/><xref ref="technique-P" acro="P" text="global"/>.)</p>
        <p>First we show that there is just one zero vector.  Notice that the properties only require there to be <em>at least</em> one, and say nothing about there possibly being more.  That is because we can use the ten properties of a vector space (<xref ref="definition-VS" acro="VS"/>) to learn that there can <em>never</em> be more than one.  To require that this extra condition be stated as an eleventh property would make the definition of a vector space more complicated than it needs to be.</p>

        <p>Our next theorem is a bit different from several of the others in the list.  Rather than making a declaration (<q>the zero vector is unique</q>) it is an implication (<q>if<ellipsis/>, then<ellipsis/></q>) and so can be used in proofs to convert a vector equality into two possibilities, one a scalar equality and the other a vector equality.  It should remind you of the situation for complex numbers.  If <m>\alpha,\,\beta\in\complexes</m> and <m>\alpha\beta=0</m>, then <m>\alpha=0</m> or <m>\beta=0</m>.

        <title>Recycling Definitions</title>
        <p>When we say that <m>V</m> is a vector space, we then know we have a set of objects (the <q>vectors</q>), but we also know we have been provided with two operations (<q>vector addition</q> and <q>scalar multiplication</q>) and these operations behave with these objects according to the ten properties of <xref ref="definition-VS" acro="VS"/>.  One combines two vectors and produces a vector, the other takes a scalar and a vector, producing a vector as the result.  So if <m>\vect{u}_1,\,\vect{u}_2,\,\vect{u}_3\in V</m> then an expression like<me>5\vect{u}_1+7\vect{u}_2-13\vect{u}_3</me>would be unambiguous in <em>any</em> of the vector spaces we have discussed in this section.  And the resulting object would be another vector in the vector space.  If you were tempted to call the above expression a linear combination, you would be right.  Four of the definitions that were central to our discussions in <xref ref="chapter-V" acro="V"/> were stated in the context of vectors being <em>column vectors</em>, but were purposely kept broad enough that they could be applied in the context of any vector space.  They only rely on the presence of scalars, vectors, vector addition and scalar multiplication to make sense.  We will restate them shortly, unchanged, except that their titles and acronyms no longer refer to column vectors, and the hypothesis of being in a vector space has been added.  Take the time now to look forward and review each one, and begin to form some connections to what we have done earlier and what we will be doing in subsequent sections and chapters.  Specifically, compare the following pairs of definitions:<ul>
