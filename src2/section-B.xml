    <title>Bases</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>A basis of a vector space is one of the most useful concepts in linear algebra.  It often provides a concise, finite description of an infinite vector space.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsection-B-B" acro="B">
        <title>Bases</title>
        <p>We now have all the tools in place to define a basis of a vector space.</p>
        <definition xml:id="definition-B" acro="B">
            <title>Basis</title>
            <idx>basis</idx>
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose <m>V</m> is a vector space.  Then a subset <m>S\subseteq V</m> is a <term>basis</term> of <m>V</m> if it is linearly independent and spans <m>V</m>.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>So, a basis is a linearly independent spanning set for a vector space.  The requirement that the set spans <m>V</m> insures that <m>S</m> has enough raw material to build <m>V</m>, while the linear independence requirement insures that we do not have any more raw material than we need.  As we shall see soon in <xref ref="section-D" acro="D"/>, a basis is a minimal spanning set.</p>
        <p>You may have noticed that we used the term basis for some of the titles of previous theorems (<eg/> <xref ref="theorem-BNS" acro="BNS"/>, <xref ref="theorem-BCS" acro="BCS"/>, <xref ref="theorem-BRS" acro="BRS"/>) and if you review each of these theorems you will see that their conclusions provide linearly independent spanning sets for sets that we now recognize as subspaces of <m>\complex{m}</m>.  Examples associated with these theorems include <xref ref="example-NSLIL" acro="NSLIL"/>, <xref ref="example-CSOCD" acro="CSOCD"/> and <xref ref="example-IAS" acro="IAS"/>.  As we will see, these three theorems will continue to be powerful tools, even in the setting of more general vector spaces.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the archetypes contain an abundance of bases.  For each coefficient matrix of a system of equations, and for each archetype defined simply as a matrix, there is a basis for the null space, <em>three</em> bases for the column space, and a basis for the row space.  For this reason, our subsequent examples will concentrate on bases for vector spaces other than <m>\complex{m}</m>.</p>
        <p>Notice that <xref ref="definition-B" acro="B"/> does not preclude a vector space from having many bases, and this is the case, as hinted above by the statement that the archetypes contain three bases for the column space of a matrix.  More generally, we can grab any basis for a vector space, multiply any one basis vector by a nonzero scalar and create a slightly different set that is still a basis.  For <q>important</q> vector spaces, it will be convenient to have a collection of <q>nice</q> bases.  When a vector space has a single particularly nice basis, it is sometimes called the <term>standard basis</term> though there is nothing precise enough about this term to allow us to define it formally <mdash/> it is a question of style.  Here are some nice bases for important vector spaces.</p>
        <theorem xml:id="theorem-SUVB" acro="SUVB">
            <title>Standard Unit Vectors are a Basis</title>

            <statement>
                <p>The set of standard unit vectors for <m>\complex{m}</m> (<xref ref="definition-SUV" acro="SUV"/>), <m>B=\setparts{\vect{e}_i}{1\leq i\leq m}</m> is a basis for the vector space <m>\complex{m}</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>We must show that the set <m>B</m> is both linearly independent and a spanning set for <m>\complex{m}</m>.  First, the vectors in <m>B</m> are, by <xref ref="definition-SUV" acro="SUV"/>, the columns of the identity matrix, which we know is nonsingular (since it row-reduces to the identity matrix, <xref ref="theorem-NMRRI" acro="NMRRI"/>).  And the columns of a nonsingular matrix are linearly independent by <xref ref="theorem-NMLIC" acro="NMLIC"/>.</p>
                <p>Suppose we grab an arbitrary vector from <m>\complex{m}</m>, say<me>\vect{v}=\colvector{v_1\\v_2\\v_3\\\vdots\\v_m}</me>.</p>
                <p>Can we write <m>\vect{v}</m> as a linear combination of the vectors in <m>B</m>?  Yes, and quite simply.<md>
                    <mrow>\colvector{v_1\\v_2\\v_3\\\vdots\\v_m}&amp;=
                    v_1\colvector{1\\0\\0\\\vdots\\0}+
                    v_2\colvector{0\\1\\0\\\vdots\\0}+
                    v_3\colvector{0\\0\\1\\\vdots\\0}+
                    \cdots+
                    v_m\colvector{0\\0\\0\\\vdots\\1}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\vect{v}&amp;=v_1\vect{e}_1+v_2\vect{e}_2+v_3\vect{e}_3+\cdots+v_m\vect{e}_m</mrow>
                </md></p>
                <p>This shows that <m>\complex{m}\subseteq\spn{B}</m>, which is sufficient to show that <m>B</m> is a spanning set for <m>\complex{m}</m>.</p>

            <p>In the vector space <m>M_{mn}</m> of matrices (<xref ref="example-VSM" acro="VSM"/>)  define the matrices <m>B_{k\ell}</m>, <m>1\leq k\leq m</m>, <m>1\leq\ell\leq n</m> by<me>\matrixentry{B_{k\ell}}{ij}=\begin{cases}

            <p>So these matrices have entries that are all zeros, with the exception of a lone entry that is one.  The set of all <m>mn</m> of them,<me>B=\setparts{B_{k\ell}}{1\leq k\leq m,\ 1\leq\ell\leq n}</me>forms a basis for <m>M_{mn}</m>.  See <xref ref="exercise-B-M20" acro="B.M20"/>.</p>

            <p>We could row-reduce the coefficient matrix of this homogeneous system, but it is not necessary.  The second and fourth equations tell us that <m>\alpha_1=0</m>, <m>\alpha_2=0</m> is the <em>only</em> solution to this homogeneous system.  This qualifies the set <m>Q</m> as being linearly independent, since the only relation of linear dependence is trivial (<xref ref="definition-LI" acro="LI"/>).

            <p>In <xref ref="example-LIC" acro="LIC"/> and <xref ref="example-SSC" acro="SSC"/> we determined that the set <m>R=\set{(1,\,0),\,(6,\,3)}</m> from the crazy vector space, <m>C</m> (<xref ref="example-CVS" acro="CVS"/>), is linearly independent and is a spanning set for <m>C</m>.  By <xref ref="definition-B" acro="B"/> we see that <m>R</m> is a basis for <m>C</m>.</p>
        </example>
        <p>We have seen that several of the sets associated with a matrix are subspaces of vector spaces of column vectors.  Specifically these are the null space (<xref ref="theorem-NSMS" acro="NSMS"/>), column space (<xref ref="theorem-CSMS" acro="CSMS"/>), row space  (<xref ref="theorem-RSMS" acro="RSMS"/>) and left null space (<xref ref="theorem-LNSMS" acro="LNSMS"/>).  As subspaces they are vector spaces (<xref ref="definition-S" acro="S"/>) and it is natural to ask about bases for these vector spaces.  <xref ref="theorem-BNS" acro="BNS"/>, <xref ref="theorem-BCS" acro="BCS"/>, <xref ref="theorem-BRS" acro="BRS"/> each have conclusions that provide linearly independent spanning sets for (respectively) the null space, column space, and row space.  Notice that each of these theorems contains the word <q>basis</q> in its title, even though we did not know the precise meaning of the word at the time.  To find a basis for a left null space we can use the definition of this subspace as a null space (<xref ref="definition-LNS" acro="LNS"/>) and  apply <xref ref="theorem-BNS" acro="BNS"/>.  Or <xref ref="theorem-FS" acro="FS"/> tells us that the left null space can be expressed as a row space and we can then use <xref ref="theorem-BRS" acro="BRS"/>.</p>
        <p><xref ref="theorem-BS" acro="BS"/> is another early result that provides a linearly independent spanning set (<ie/> a basis) as its conclusion.  If a vector space of column vectors can be expressed as a span of a set of column vectors, then <xref ref="theorem-BS" acro="BS"/> can be employed in a straightforward manner to quickly yield a basis.</p>

        <title>Bases for Spans of Column Vectors</title>
        <p>We have seen several examples of bases in different vector spaces.  In this subsection, and the next (<xref ref="subsection-B-BNM" acro="B.BNM"/>), we will consider building bases for <m>\complex{m}</m> and its subspaces.</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a subspace of <m>\complex{m}</m> that is expressed as the span of a set of vectors, <m>S</m>, and <m>S</m> is not necessarily linearly independent, or perhaps not very attractive.  <xref ref="theorem-REMRS" acro="REMRS"/> says that row-equivalent matrices have identical row spaces, while <xref ref="theorem-BRS" acro="BRS"/> says the nonzero rows of a matrix in reduced row-echelon form are a basis for the row space.  These theorems together give us a great computational tool for quickly finding a basis for a subspace that is expressed originally as a span.</p>

                <h>basis</h>
            </idx>
            <p>When we first defined the span of a set of column vectors, in <xref ref="example-SCAD" acro="SCAD"/> we looked at the set<me>W=\spn{\set{
            \colvector{2\\-3\\1},\,
            \colvector{1\\4\\1},\,
            \colvector{7\\-5\\4},\,
            \colvector{-7\\-6\\-5}
            }}</me>with an eye towards realizing <m>W</m> as the span of a smaller set.  By building relations of linear dependence (though we did not know them by that name then) we were able to remove two vectors and write <m>W</m> as the span of the other two vectors.  These two remaining vectors formed a linearly independent set, even though we did not know that at the time.</p>
            <p>Now we know that <m>W</m> is a subspace and must have a basis.  Consider the matrix, <m>C</m>, whose rows are the vectors in the spanning set for <m>W</m>,<me>C=\begin{bmatrix}

            -7 &amp; -6 &amp; -5
            \end{bmatrix}</me>.</p>
            <p>Then, by <xref ref="definition-RSM" acro="RSM"/>, the row space of <m>C</m> will be <m>W</m>, <m>\rsp{C}=W</m>.<xref ref="theorem-BRS" acro="BRS"/> tells us that if we row-reduce <m>C</m>, the nonzero rows of the row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form will be a basis for <m>\rsp{C}</m>, and hence a basis for <m>W</m>.  Let us do it <mdash/> <m>C</m> row-reduces to<me>\begin{bmatrix}
            \leading{1} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{7}{11}\\
            0 &amp; \leading{1} &amp; \frac{1}{11}\\
            0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
            0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
            \end{bmatrix}</me>.</p>
            <p>If we convert the two nonzero rows to column vectors then we have a basis,<me>B=\set{\colvector{1\\0\\\frac{7}{11}},\,\colvector{0\\1\\\frac{1}{11}}}</me>and<me>W=\spn{\set{\colvector{1\\0\\\frac{7}{11}},\,\colvector{0\\1\\\frac{1}{11}}}}</me>.</p>
            <p>For aesthetic reasons, we might wish to multiply each vector in <m>B</m> by <m>11</m>, which will not change the spanning or linear independence properties of <m>B</m> as a basis.  Then we can also write<me>W=\spn{\set{\colvector{11\\0\\7},\,\colvector{0\\11\\1}}}</me>.</p>
        </example>
        <p><xref ref="example-IAS" acro="IAS"/> provides another example of this flavor, though now we can notice that <m>X</m> is a subspace, and that the resulting set of three vectors is a basis.  This is such a powerful technique that we should do one more example.</p>

            <p>Here is another way to accomplish something similar.  The row space of the matrix<me>A=\begin{bmatrix}
            1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2\\
            2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\
            0 &amp; -7 &amp; 6 &amp; -11 &amp; -2\\
            4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 6
            \end{bmatrix}</me>is equal to <m>\spn{R}</m>.  By <xref ref="theorem-BRS" acro="BRS"/> we can row-reduce this matrix, ignore any zero rows, and use the nonzero rows as column vectors that are a basis for the row space of <m>A</m>.  Row-reducing <m>A</m> creates the matrix<me>\begin{bmatrix}
            1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{1}{17} &amp; \frac{30}{17}\\
            0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{25}{17} &amp; -\frac{2}{17}\\
            0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -\frac{2}{17} &amp; -\frac{8}{17}\\
            0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
            \end{bmatrix}</me>.</p>
            <p>So<me>\set{
            \colvector{1\\0\\0\\-\frac{1}{17}\\\frac{30}{17}},\,
            \colvector{0\\1\\0\\\frac{25}{17}\\-\frac{2}{17}},\,
            \colvector{0\\0\\1\\-\frac{2}{17}\\-\frac{8}{17}}
            }</me>is a basis for <m>V</m>.  Our theorem tells us this is a basis, there is no need to verify that the subspace spanned by three vectors (rather than four) is the identical subspace, and there is no need to verify that we have reached the limit in reducing the set, since the set of three vectors is guaranteed to be linearly independent.</p>

            <p>Every vector space in Sage has a basis <mdash/> you can obtain this with the vector space method <c>.basis()</c>, and the result is a list of vectors.  Another method for a vector space is <c>.basis_matrix()</c> which outputs a matrix whose rows are the vectors of a basis.  Sometimes one form is more convenient than the other, but notice that the description of a vector space chooses to print the basis matrix (since its display is just a bit easier to read).  A vector space typically has many bases (infinitely many), so which one does Sage use?

            <p>Or perhaps, <q>under the bonnet</q> if you learned your English in the Commonwealth.  This is the first in a series that aims to explain how our knowledge of linear algebra <em>theory</em> helps us understand the design, construction and informed use of Sage.</p>
            <p>How does Sage determine if two vector spaces are equal?  Especially since these are infinite sets?  One approach would be to take a spanning set for the first vector space (maybe a minimal spanning set), and ask if each element of the spanning set is an element of the second vector space.  If so, the first vector space is a subset of the second.  Then we could turn it around, and determine if the second vector space is a subset of the first.  By <xref ref="definition-SE" acro="SE"/>, the two vector spaces would be equal if both subset tests succeeded.</p>
            <p>However, each time we would test if an element of a spanning set lives in a second vector space, we would need to solve a linear system.  So for two large vector spaces, this could take a noticeable amount of time.  There is a better way, made possible by exploiting two important theorems.</p>
            <p>For every vector space, Sage creates a basis that uniquely identifies the vector space.  We could call this a <term>canonical basis</term>.  By <xref ref="theorem-REMRS" acro="REMRS"/> we can span the row space of a matrix by the rows of any row-equivalent matrix.  So if we begin with a vector space described by any basis (or any spanning set, for that matter), we can make a matrix with these rows as vectors, and the vector space is now the row space of the matrix.  Of all the possible row-equivalent matrices, which would you pick?  Of course, the reduced row-echelon version is useful, and here it is critical to realize this version is unique (<xref ref="theorem-RREFU" acro="RREFU"/>).</p>
            <p>So for every vector space, Sage takes a spanning set, makes its vectors the rows of a matrix, row-reduces the matrix and tosses out the zero rows.  The result is what Sage calls an <term>echelonized basis</term>.  Now, two vector spaces are equal if, and only if, they have equal <term>echelonized basis matrices</term>.  It takes some computation to form the echelonized basis, but once built, the comparison of two echelonized bases can proceed very quickly by perhaps just comparing entries of the echelonized basis matrices.</p>
            <p>You might create a vector space with a basis you prefer (a <term>user basis</term>), but Sage always has an echelonized basis at hand.  If you do not specify some alternate basis, this is the basis Sage will create and provide for you.  We can now continue a discussion we began back in Sage<nbsp/><xref ref="sage-SSNS" acro="SSNS" text="global"/>.  We have consistently used the <c>basis='pivot'</c> keyword when we construct null spaces.  This is because we initially prefer to see the basis described in <xref ref="theorem-BNS" acro="BNS"/>, rather than Sage's default basis, the echelonized version.  But the echelonized version is always present and available.</p>

        <title>Orthonormal Bases and Coordinates</title>
        <p>We learned about orthogonal sets of vectors in <m>\complex{m}</m> back in <xref ref="section-O" acro="O"/>, and we also learned that orthogonal sets are automatically linearly independent (<xref ref="theorem-OSLI" acro="OSLI"/>).  When an orthogonal set also spans a subspace of <m>\complex{m}</m>, then the set is a basis.  And when the set is orthonormal, then the set is an incredibly nice basis.  We will back up this claim with a theorem, but first consider how you might manufacture such a set.</p>
        <p>Suppose that <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\complex{m}</m> with basis <m>B</m>.  Then <m>B</m> spans <m>W</m> and is a linearly independent set of nonzero vectors.  We can apply the Gram-Schmidt Procedure (<xref ref="theorem-GSP" acro="GSP"/>) and obtain a linearly independent set <m>T</m> such that <m>\spn{T}=\spn{B}=W</m> and <m>T</m> is orthogonal.  In other words, <m>T</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>, and is an orthogonal set.  By scaling each vector of <m>T</m> to norm 1, we can convert <m>T</m> into an orthonormal set, without destroying the properties that make it a basis of <m>W</m>.  In short, we can convert any basis into an orthonormal basis.  <xref ref="example-GSTV" acro="GSTV"/>, followed by <xref ref="example-ONTV" acro="ONTV"/>, illustrates this process.</p>
        <p>Unitary matrices (<xref ref="definition-UM" acro="UM"/>) are another good source of orthonormal bases (and vice versa).  Suppose that <m>Q</m> is a unitary matrix of size <m>n</m>.  Then the <m>n</m> columns of <m>Q</m> form an orthonormal set (<xref ref="theorem-CUMOS" acro="CUMOS"/>) that is therefore linearly independent (<xref ref="theorem-OSLI" acro="OSLI"/>).  Since <m>Q</m> is invertible (<xref ref="theorem-UMI" acro="UMI"/>), we know <m>Q</m> is nonsingular (<xref ref="theorem-NI" acro="NI"/>), and then the columns of <m>Q</m> span <m>\complex{n}</m> (<xref ref="theorem-CSNM" acro="CSNM"/>).  So the columns of a unitary matrix of size <m>n</m> are an orthonormal basis for <m>\complex{n}</m>.</p>
        <p>Why all the fuss about orthonormal bases?  <xref ref="theorem-VRRB" acro="VRRB"/> told us that any vector in a vector space could be written, uniquely, as a linear combination of basis vectors.  For an orthonormal basis, finding the scalars for this linear combination is extremely easy, and this is the content of the next theorem.  Furthermore, with vectors written this way (as linear combinations of the elements of an orthonormal set) certain computations and analysis become much easier.  Here is the promised theorem.</p>

                <p>Suppose that <m>B=\set{\vectorlist{v}{p}}</m> is an orthonormal basis of the subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\complex{m}</m>.  For any <m>\vect{w}\in W</m>,<me>\vect{w}=

So it is not this aspect of the conclusion that makes this theorem interesting.  What is interesting is that the particular scalars are so easy to compute.  No need to solve big systems of equations <mdash/> just do an inner product of <m>\vect{w}</m> with <m>\vect{v}_i</m> to arrive at the coefficient of <m>\vect{v}_i</m> in the linear combination.</p>

        <p>Not only do the columns of a unitary matrix form an orthonormal basis, but there is a deeper connection between orthonormal bases and unitary matrices.  Informally, the next theorem says that if we transform each vector of an orthonormal basis by multiplying it by a unitary matrix, then the resulting set will be another orthonormal basis.  And more remarkably, any matrix with this property must be unitary!  As an equivalence (Proof Technique<nbsp/><xref ref="technique-E" acro="E" text="global"/>) we could take this as our defining property of a unitary matrix, though it might not have the same utility as <xref ref="definition-UM" acro="UM"/>.</p>

            <p>For vector spaces of column vectors, Sage can quickly determine the coordinates of a vector relative to a basis, as guaranteed by <xref ref="theorem-VRRB" acro="VRRB"/>.  We illustrate some new Sage commands with a simple example and then apply them to orthonormal bases.  The vectors <c>v1</c> and <c>v2</c> are linearly independent and thus span a subspace with a basis of size 2.  We first create this subspace and let Sage determine the basis, then we illustrate a new vector space method, <c>.subspace_with_basis()</c>, that allows us to specify the basis.  (This method is very similar to <c>.span_of_basis()</c>, except it preserves a subspace relationship with the original vector space.)  Notice how the description of the vector space makes it clear that <c>W</c> has a user-specified basis.  Notice too that the actual subspace created is the same in both cases.</p>
