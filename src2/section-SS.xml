    <title>Spanning Sets</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>In this section we will provide an extremely compact way to describe an infinite set of vectors, making use of linear combinations.  This will give us a convenient way to describe the solution set of a linear system, the null space of a matrix, and many other sets of vectors.</p>

        <title>Span of a Set of Vectors</title>
        <p>In <xref ref="example-VFSAL" acro="VFSAL"/> we saw the solution set of a homogeneous system described as all possible linear combinations of two particular vectors.  This is a useful way to construct or describe infinite sets of vectors, so we encapsulate the idea in a definition.</p>

        <p>The span is just a set of vectors, though in all but one situation it is an infinite set.  (Just when is it not infinite?  See <xref ref="exercise-SS-T30" />.)  So we start with a finite collection of vectors <m>S</m> (<m>p</m> of them to be precise), and use this finite set to describe an infinite set of vectors, <m>\spn{S}</m>.  Confusing the <em>finite</em> set <m>S</m> with the <em>infinite</em> set <m>\spn{S}</m> is one of the most persistent problems in understanding introductory linear algebra.  We will see this construction repeatedly, so let us work through some examples to get comfortable with it.  The most obvious question about a set is if a particular item of the correct type is in the set, or not in the set.</p>

            <p>The purpose of a set is to collect objects with some common property, and to exclude objects without that property.  So the most fundamental question about a set is if a given object is an element of the set or not.  Let us learn more about <m>\spn{S}</m> by investigating which vectors are elements of the set, and which are not.</p>
            <p>First, is <m>\vect{u}=\colvector{-15\\-6\\19\\5}</m> an element of <m>\spn{S}</m>?  We are asking if there are scalars <m>\alpha_1,\,\alpha_2,\,\alpha_3,\,\alpha_4,\,\alpha_5</m> such that<me>\alpha_1\colvector{1 \\ 1 \\ 3 \\ 1}+
            \alpha_2\colvector{2 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ -1}+

            =\vect{u}
            =\colvector{-15\\-6\\19\\5}</me>?</p>
            <p>Applying <xref ref="theorem-SLSLC" acro="SLSLC"/> we recognize the search for these scalars as a solution to a linear system of equations with augmented matrix and reduced row-echelon form<md>

            <p>At this point, we see that the system is consistent (<xref ref="theorem-RCLS" acro="RCLS"/>), so we know there <em>is</em> a solution for the five scalars <m>\alpha_1,\,\alpha_2,\,\alpha_3,\,\alpha_4,\,\alpha_5</m>.

            \right\}</me>and consider the infinite set <m>\spn{S}</m>.  The vectors of <m>S</m> could have been chosen to be anything, but for reasons that will become clear later, we have chosen the three columns of the coefficient matrix in Archetype<nbsp/><xref ref="archetype-A" acro="A" text="global"/>.</p>
            <p>First, as an example, note that<me>\vect{v}=(5)\colvector{1\\2\\1}+(-3)\colvector{-1\\1\\1}+(7)\colvector{2\\1\\0}=\colvector{22\\14\\2}</me>is in <m>\spn{S}</m>, since it is a linear combination of <m>\vect{u}_1,\,\vect{u}_2,\,\vect{u}_3</m>.  We write this succinctly as <m>\vect{v}\in\spn{S}</m>.  There is nothing magical about the scalars <m>\alpha_1=5,\,\alpha_2=-3,\,\alpha_3=7</m>, they could have been chosen to be anything.  So repeat this part of the example yourself, using different values of <m>\alpha_1,\,\alpha_2,\,\alpha_3</m>.  What happens if you choose all three scalars to be zero?</p>
            <p>So we know how to quickly construct sample elements of the set <m>\spn{S}</m>.  A slightly different question arises when you are handed a vector of the correct size and asked if it is an element of <m>\spn{S}</m>.

            <p>This system has infinitely many solutions (there is a free variable in <m>x_3</m>), but all we need is one solution vector.  The solution <m>\alpha_1 = 2</m>, <m>\alpha_2 = 3</m>, <m>\alpha_3 = 1</m>, tells us that<me>(2)\vect{u}_1+(3)\vect{u}_2+(1)\vect{u}_3=\vect{w}</me>so we are convinced that <m>\vect{w}</m> really is in <m>\spn{S}</m>.

More precisely, <m>\vect{y}\not\in\spn{S}</m>.</p>
            <p>There are three things to observe in this example.  (1) It is easy to construct vectors in <m>\spn{S}</m>.  (2) It is possible that some vectors are in <m>\spn{S}</m> (<eg/> <m>\vect{w}</m>), while others are not (<eg/> <m>\vect{y}</m>).

            <p>With a computer program in hand to solve systems of linear equations, could you create a program to decide if a vector was, or was not, in the span of a given set of vectors?  Is this art or science?</p>

This particular coefficient matrix is nonsingular, so by <xref ref="theorem-NMUS" acro="NMUS"/>, the system is guaranteed to have a solution.  (This solution is unique, but that is not critical here.)

            <p>A strength of Sage is the ability to create infinite sets, such as the span of a set of vectors, from finite descriptions.  In other words, we can take a finite set with just a handful of vectors and Sage will create the set that is the span of these vectors, which is an infinite set.  Here we will show you how to do this, and show how you can use the results.  The key command is the vector space method <c>.span()</c>.</p>

            <p>Most of the above should be fairly self-explanatory, but a few comments are in order.  The span, <c>W</c>, is created in the first compute cell with the <c>.span()</c> method, which accepts a list of vectors and needs to be employed as a method of a vector space.  The information about <c>W</c> printed when we just input the span itself may be somewhat confusing, and as before, we need to learn some more theory to totally understand it all.  For now you can see the number system (<c>Rational Field</c>) and the number of entries in each vector (<c>degree 4</c>).  The <c>dimension</c> may be more complicated than you first suspect.</p>
            <p>Sets are all about membership, and we see that we can easily check membership in a span.  We know the vector <c>x</c> will be in the span <c>W</c> since we built it as a linear combination of <c>v1</c> and <c>v2</c>.  The vectors <c>y</c> and <c>u</c> are a bit more mysterious, but Sage can answer the membership question easily for both.</p>
            <p>The last compute cell is something new.  The symbol <c>&lt;=</c> is meant here to be the <q>subset of</q> relation, <ie/> a slight abuse of the mathematical symbol <m>\subseteq</m>, and then we are not surprised to learn that <c>W</c> really is a subset of <c>V</c>.</p>
            <p>It is important to realize that the span is a <em>construction</em> that begins with a finite set, yet creates an infinite set.  With a loop (the <c>for</c> command) and the <c>.random_element()</c> vector space method we can create <em>many</em>, but not all, of the elements of a span.  In the examples below, you can edit the total number of random vectors produced, and if you create too many you may make it difficult (or impossible) to wade through them all.</p>
            <p>Each example is designed to illustrate some aspect of the behavior of the span command and to provoke some questions.  So put on your mathematician's hat, evaluate the compute cells to create some sample elements, and then <em>study</em> the output carefully looking for patterns and maybe even conjecture some explanations for the behavior.  The puzzle gets just a bit harder for each new example.  (We use the <c>Sequence()</c> command to get nicely-formatted line-by-line output of the list, and notice that we are only providing a portion of the output here.  You will want to evalaute the computation of <c>vecs</c> and then evaluate the subsequent cell for maximum effect.)</p>

            <p>With the notion of a span, we can expand our techniques for checking the consistency of a linear system.  <xref ref="theorem-SLSLC" acro="SLSLC"/> tells us a system is consistent if and only if the vector of constants is a linear combination of the columns of the coefficient matrix.  This is because <xref ref="theorem-SLSLC" acro="SLSLC"/> says that any solution to the system will provide a linear combination of the columns of the coefficient that equals the vector of constants.  So consistency of a system is equivalent to the membership of the vector of constants in the span of the columns of the coefficient matrix.  Read that last sentence again carefully.  We will see this idea again, but more formally, in <xref ref="theorem-CSCS" acro="CSCS"/>.</p>
            <p>We will reprise Sage<nbsp/><xref ref="sage-SLC" acro="SLC" text="global"/>, which is based on Archetype<nbsp/><xref ref="archetype-F" acro="F" text="global"/>.  We again make use of the matrix method <c>.columns()</c> to get all of the columns into a list at once.</p>

            <p>So with a trivial null space, we know the matrix is nonsingular by <xref ref="theorem-NMTNS" acro="NMTNS"/>.  Then a nonsingular coefficient matrix always creates a system with a unique solution by <xref ref="theorem-NMUS" acro="NMUS"/>.</p>
            <p>The system is consistent, as we have shown, so we can apply <xref ref="theorem-PSPHS" acro="PSPHS"/>. We can read <xref ref="theorem-PSPHS" acro="PSPHS"/> as saying <em>any</em> two different solutions of the system will differ by an element of the null space, and the only possibility for this null space vector is just the zero vector.  In other words, any two solutions <em>cannot</em> be different, so the solution is unique.</p>

        <p>We saw in <xref ref="example-VFSAL" acro="VFSAL"/> that when a system of equations is homogeneous the solution set can be expressed in the form described by <xref ref="theorem-VFSLS" acro="VFSLS"/> where the vector <m>\vect{c}</m> is the zero vector.  We can essentially ignore this vector, so that the remainder of the typical expression for a solution looks like an arbitrary linear combination, where the scalars are the free variables and the vectors are <m>\vectorlist{u}{n-r}</m>.

            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>First, note that when <m>n=r</m>, the set in the span is empty, and the conclusion is true.  So we assume for the remainder that <m>n\gt r</m>.  (You might look at the discussion in <xref ref="solution-SS-T20" />.)</p>
                <p>Consider the homogeneous system with <m>A</m> as a coefficient matrix, <m>\homosystem{A}</m>.  Its set of solutions, <m>S</m>, is by <xref ref="definition-NSM" acro="NSM"/>, the null space of <m>A</m>, <m>\nsp{A}</m>.  Let <m>B^{\prime}</m> denote the result of row-reducing the augmented matrix of this homogeneous system.  Since the system is homogeneous, the final column of the augmented matrix will be all zeros, and after any number of row operations (<xref ref="definition-RO" acro="RO"/>), the column will still be all zeros.  So <m>B^{\prime}</m> has a final column that is totally zeros.</p>
                <p>Now apply <xref ref="theorem-VFSLS" acro="VFSLS"/> to <m>B^{\prime}</m>, after noting that our homogeneous system must be consistent (<xref ref="theorem-HSC" acro="HSC"/>).  The vector <m>\vect{c}</m> has zeros for each entry that has an index in <m>F</m>.  For entries with their index in <m>D</m>, the value is <m>-\matrixentry{B^{\prime}}{k,{n+1}}</m>, but for <m>B^{\prime}</m> any entry in the final column (index <m>n+1</m>) is zero.  So <m>\vect{c}=\zerovector</m>.  The vectors <m>\vect{z}_j</m>, <m>1\leq j\leq n-r</m> are identical to the vectors <m>\vect{u}_j</m>, <m>1\leq j\leq n-r</m> described in <xref ref="theorem-VFSLS" acro="VFSLS"/>.

            <p>We will mechanically follow the prescription of <xref ref="theorem-SSNS" acro="SSNS"/>.  Here we go, in two big steps.</p>
            <p>First, the non-pivot columns have indices <m>F=\set{3,\,5,\,6}</m>, so we will construct the <m>n-r=6-3=3</m> vectors with a pattern of zeros and ones dictated by the indices in <m>F</m>.

            </md></p>
            <p>Each of these vectors arises due to the presence of a column that is not a pivot column.  The remaining entries of each vector are the entries of the non-pivot column, negated, and distributed into the empty slots in order (these slots have indices in the set <m>D</m>, so also refer to pivot columns).  This is the realization of the third line of the three-case definition of the vectors <m>\vect{z}_j</m>, <m>1\leq j\leq n-r</m>.<md>
                <mrow>\vect{z}_1&amp;=\colvector{-2\\ -1\\ 1\\  0 \\0 \\ 0}

            <p>Now is an appropriate time to comment on how Sage displays a null space when we just ask about it alone.  Just as with a span, the number system and the number of entries are easy to see.  Again, <c>dimension</c> should wait for a bit.  But you will notice now that the <c>Basis matrix</c> has been replaced by <c>User basis matrix</c>.  This is a consequence of our request for something other than the default basis (the <c>'pivot'</c> basis).  As part of its standard information about a null space, or a span, Sage spits out the basis matrix.  This is a matrix, whose <em>rows</em> are vectors in a spanning set.  This matrix can be requested by itself, using the method <c>.basis_matrix()</c>.  It is important to notice that this is very different than the output of <c>.basis()</c> which is a list of vectors.  The two objects print very similarly, but even this is different <mdash/> compare the organization of the brackets and parentheses.  Finally the last command should print true for <em>any</em> span or null space Sage creates.  If you rerun the commands below, be sure the null space <c>nsp</c> is defined from the code just above.</p>

        <p>Here is an example that will simultaneously exercise the span construction and <xref ref="theorem-SSNS" acro="SSNS"/>, while also pointing the way to the next section.</p>
        <example xml:id="example-SCAD" acro="SCAD">
            <idx>
                <h>span of columns</h>

            <title>Span of the columns of Archetype D</title>
            <p>Begin with <m>T</m>, a the set of four vectors of size <m>3</m> chosen as the four columns of the coefficient matrix in Archetype<nbsp/><xref ref="archetype-D" acro="D" text="global"/>.  Check that the vector <m>\vect{z}_2</m> is in the null space of the coefficient matrix of Archetype<nbsp/><xref ref="archetype-D" acro="D" text="global"/>, <m>\nsp{D}</m>. In fact, it is one of the vectors provided by <xref ref="theorem-SSNS" acro="SSNS"/>.<md>
                <mrow>T&amp;=\set{\vect{w}_1,\,\vect{w}_2,\,\vect{w}_3,\,\vect{w}_4}
                =\set{
                \colvector{2\\-3\\1},\,
                \colvector{1\\4\\1},\,
                \colvector{7\\-5\\4},\,
                \colvector{-7\\-6\\-5}
                }
                &amp;
                \vect{z}_2&amp;=\colvector{2\\3\\0\\1}</mrow>
            </md>Now consider the infinite set <m>W=\spn{T}</m>.</p>
            <p>Applying <xref ref="theorem-SLSLC" acro="SLSLC"/>, we can write the linear combination<me>2\vect{w}_1+3\vect{w}_2+0\vect{w}_3+1\vect{w}_4=\zerovector</me>which we can solve for <m>\vect{w}_4</m><me>\vect{w}_4=(-2)\vect{w}_1+(-3)\vect{w}_2</me>.</p>
            <p>This equation says that whenever we encounter the vector <m>\vect{w}_4</m>, we can replace it with a specific linear combination of the vectors <m>\vect{w}_1</m> and <m>\vect{w}_2</m>.  So using <m>\vect{w}_4</m> in the set <m>T</m>, along with <m>\vect{w}_1</m> and <m>\vect{w}_2</m>, is excessive.  An example of what we mean here can be illustrated by the computation<md>
                <mrow>5\vect{w}_1&amp;+(-4)\vect{w}_2+6\vect{w}_3+(-3)\vect{w}_4</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp;=5\vect{w}_1+(-4)\vect{w}_2+6\vect{w}_3+(-3)\left((-2)\vect{w}_1+(-3)\vect{w}_2\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp;=5\vect{w}_1+(-4)\vect{w}_2+6\vect{w}_3+\left(6\vect{w}_1+9\vect{w}_2\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp;=11\vect{w}_1+5\vect{w}_2+6\vect{w}_3</mrow>
            </md>.</p>
            <p>So what began as a linear combination of the vectors <m>\vect{w}_1,\,\vect{w}_2,\,\vect{w}_3,\,\vect{w}_4</m> has been reduced to a linear combination of the vectors <m>\vect{w}_1,\,\vect{w}_2,\,\vect{w}_3</m>.  A careful proof using our definition of set equality (<xref ref="definition-SE" acro="SE"/>) would now allow us to conclude that this reduction is possible for any vector in <m>W</m>, so<me>W=\spn{\left\{\vect{w}_1,\,\vect{w}_2,\,\vect{w}_3\right\}}</me>.  So the set  <m>W</m> has not changed, but we have <em>described</em> it as the span of a set of <em>three</em> vectors, rather than as the span of a set of <em>four</em> vectors.  Furthermore, we can achieve yet another, similar, reduction.</p>
            <p>Check that the vector<me>\vect{z}_1=\colvector{-3\\-1\\1\\0}</me>is a solution to the homogeneous system <m>\linearsystem{D}{\zerovector}</m> (it is the  vector <m>\vect{z}_1</m> provided by the description of the null space of the coefficient matrix <m>D</m> from <xref ref="theorem-SSNS" acro="SSNS"/>).  Applying <xref ref="theorem-SLSLC" acro="SLSLC"/>, we can write the linear combination,<me>(-3)\vect{w}_1+(-1)\vect{w}_2+1\vect{w}_3=\zerovector</me>which we can solve for <m>\vect{w}_3</m>,<me>\vect{w}_3=3\vect{w}_1+1\vect{w}_2</me>.</p>
            <p>This equation says that whenever we encounter the vector <m>\vect{w}_3</m>, we can replace it with a specific linear combination of the vectors <m>\vect{w}_1</m> and <m>\vect{w}_2</m>.  So, as before, the vector <m>\vect{w}_3</m> is not needed in the description of <m>W</m>, provided we have <m>\vect{w}_1</m> and <m>\vect{w}_2</m> available.  In particular, a careful proof (such as is done in <xref ref="example-RSC5" acro="RSC5"/>) would show that<me>W=\spn{\left\{\vect{w}_1,\,\vect{w}_2\right\}}</me>.</p>
            <p>So <m>W</m> began life as the span of a set of four vectors, and we have now shown (utilizing solutions to a homogeneous system) that <m>W</m> can also be described as the span of a set of just two vectors.  Convince yourself that we cannot go any further.  In other words, it is not possible to dismiss either <m>\vect{w}_1</m> or <m>\vect{w}_2</m> in a similar fashion and winnow the set down to just one vector.</p>
            <p>What was it about the original set of four vectors that allowed us to declare certain vectors as surplus?  And just which vectors were we able to dismiss?  And why did we have to stop once we had two vectors remaining?  The answers to these questions motivate <q>linear independence,</q> our next section and next definition, and so are worth considering carefully <em>now</em>.</p>

            <p>We have deferred several mysteries and postponed some explanations of the terms Sage uses to describe certain objects.  This is because Sage is a comprehensive tool that you can use throughout your mathematical career, and Sage assumes you already know a lot of linear algebra.  Do not worry, you already know <em>some</em> linear algebra and we will very soon will know a <em>whole lot more</em>.  And we know enough now that we can now solve one mystery.  How can we create <em>all</em> of the solutions to a linear system of equations when the solution set is infinite?</p>
            <p><xref ref="theorem-VFSLS" acro="VFSLS"/> described elements of a solution set as a single vector <m>\vect{c}</m>, plus linear combinations of vectors <m>\vectorlist{u}{n-r}</m>.  The vectors <m>\vect{u}_j</m> are identical to the vectors <m>\vect{z}_j</m> in the description of the spanning set of a null space in <xref ref="theorem-SSNS" acro="SSNS"/>, suitably adjusted from the setting of a general system and the relevant homogeneous system for a null space.  We can get the single vector <m>\vect{c}</m> from the <c>.solve_right()</c> method of a coefficient matrix, once supplied with the vector of constants.  The vectors <m>\set{\vectorlist{z}{n-r}}</m> come from Sage in the basis returned by the <c>.right_kernel(basis='pivot')</c> method applied to the coefficient matrix.  <xref ref="theorem-PSPHS" acro="PSPHS"/> amplifies and generalizes this discussion, making it clear that the choice of the particular particular solution <m>\vect{c}</m> (Sage's choice, and your author's choice) is just a matter of convenience.</p>
            <p>In our previous discussion, we used the system from <xref ref="example-ISSI" acro="ISSI"/>.  We will use it one more time.</p>

                <p>For which sets <m>S</m> is <m>\spn{S}</m> a finite set?  Give a proof for your answer.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution xml:id="solution-SS-T30">
                <p>If <m>S</m> is empty or <m>S=\set{\zerovector}</m> then <m>\spn{S}=\set{\zerovector}</m> and is finite.  If <m>S</m> contains any nonzero vector, then all of the scalar multiples of that vector are in the span, and hence the span is infinite.</p>
