We have worked extensively in the last chapter with matrices, and some with vectors.  In this chapter we will develop the properties of vectors, while preparing to study vector spaces (\acronymref{chapter}{VS}).  Initially we will depart from our study of systems of linear equations, but in \acronymref{section}{LC} we will forge a connection between linear combinations and systems of linear equations in \acronymref{theorem}{SLSLC}.  This connection will allow us to understand systems of linear equations at a higher level, while consequently discussing them less frequently.
