We now have a computational toolkit in place and so we can begin our study of linear algebra in a more theoretical style.\par

Linear algebra is the study of two fundamental objects, vector spaces and linear transformations (see \acronymref{chapter}{LT}).  This chapter will focus on the former.  The power of mathematics is often derived from generalizing many different situations into one abstract formulation, and that is exactly what we will be doing throughout this chapter.
