MAJOR SOURCE FORMAT CHANGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 2.99 is the last version that is guaranteed to compile from the
LaTeX sources initiated in December 2003.  Content has all migrated
to an XML format, using a one-off conversion process, custom XML tags
and LaTeX syntax for in-line and displayed mathematics.

Changes to the LaTeX sources subsequent to Version 2.99 are
designed to support the automated conversion to XML and some
new environments (e.g. "introduction", "para", "graphics") are
not implemented in the corresponding style files.  Additional
content has been integrated, such as Tikz graphics and the Sage
vignettes.

v2.99 source (as published, or with additions) may be recreated
in two ways:
(a) rolling back to the version "2.99" Mercurial tag (published version)
(b) in the new "latex" subdirectory (source with additions).

Change:  Exercises VO.T05, VO.T06, VO.T07: proofs re-written

v2.90  2012/06/17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MAJOR CHANGE:
    The inner product is now "reversed" from what it was formerly.
    Specifically, the entries of the *first* vector are conjugated now.
  Rationale:
    This will make properties for numerous matrix decompositions and other
    aspects of orthogonality simpler and more natural.  This is already
    evident as several proofs have been shortened and simplified.
  Changes:
    Definition IP - root cause
    Theorem IPSM - now scalar multiples of first vector
                   "come out" conjugated
    Theorem MMIP - conjugate and transpose both now affect first vector
    Theorem GSP - order in inner products reversed.  Necessary for the proof
                  but also preserves any existing computations
    Theorem COB - order in inner products reversed.  Necessary for the proof
                  but also preserves any existing computations
    Proofs - Many proofs depend on the five items above and have been
             rewritten.  Generally they are equivalent or simpler.  These
             changes are not documented here.  See the revision history, which
             is organized by section, or search on uses of the theorems above.
    Limitations - Changes only go through Section CB.  Remaining sections will
                  be adjusted as edited.
