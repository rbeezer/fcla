For Exercises C21--C28, find the solution set of the given system of linear equations. Identify the values of $n$ and $r$, and compare your answers to the results of the theorems of this section.\\
\exercise{C21}{\chrisblack}     % 3 x 4 system; no solutions
\exercise{C22}{\chrisblack}     % 3 x 4 system; infinite solutions
\exercise{C23}{\chrisblack}     % 3 x 4 system; no solutions
\exercise{C24}{\chrisblack}     % 3 x 4 system; infinite solutions -- 2 free variables
\exercise{C25}{\chrisblack}     % 4 x 3 system; no solutions
\exercise{C26}{\chrisblack}     % 4 x 3 system; one solution
\exercise{C27}{\chrisblack}     % 4 x 3 system; no solutions

\exercise{M45}{\robertbeezer}   % infinite solutions in Archetype J, no rref
\exercise{M46}{\manleyperkel}   % various entries of row-reduced Archetype J

For Exercises M51--M57  say {\bf as much as possible} about each system's solution set.  Be sure to make it clear which theorems you are using to reach your conclusions.\\
