Consider each archetype that is a system of equations. For individual solutions listed (both for the original system and the corresponding homogeneous system) express the vector of constants as a linear combination of the columns of the coefficient matrix, as guaranteed by \acronymref{theorem}{SLSLC}.  Verify this equality by computing the linear combination.  For systems with no solutions, recognize that it is then impossible to write the vector of constants as a linear combination of the columns of the coefficient matrix.  Note too, for homogeneous systems, that the solutions give rise to linear combinations that equal the zero vector.\\
