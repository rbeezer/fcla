<title>Matrices</title>

<introduction>
<p>We have made frequent use of matrices for solving systems of equations, and we have begun to investigate a few of their properties, such as the null space and nonsingularity.  In this chapter, we will take a more systematic approach to the study of matrices.</p>

<annoacro type="theorem" acro="VSPM">
<p>
These are the fundamental rules for working with the addition, and scalar multiplication, of matrices.  We saw something very similar in the previous chapter (<acroref type="theorem" acro="VSPCV" />).  Together, these two definitions will provide our definition for the key definition, <acroref type="definition" acro="VS" />.
</p>
</annoacro>
<annoacro type="theorem" acro="SLEMM">
<p>
<acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" /> connected linear combinations with systems of equations.  <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" /> connects the matrix-vector product (<acroref type="definition" acro="MVP" />) and column vector equality (<acroref type="definition" acro="CVE" />) with systems of equations.   We'll see this one regularly.
</p>
</annoacro>
<annoacro type="theorem" acro="EMP">
<p>
This theorem is a workhorse in <acroref type="section" acro="MM" /> and will continue to make regular appearances.  If you want to get better at formulating proofs, the application of this theorem can be a key step in gaining that broader understanding.  While it might be hard to imagine <acroref type="theorem" acro="EMP" /> as a <em>definition</em> of matrix multiplication, we'll see in <acroref type="exercise" acro="MR.T80" /> that in theory it is actually a <em>better</em> definition of matrix multiplication long-term.

<annoacro type="theorem" acro="CINM">
<p>
The inverse of a matrix is key.  Here's how you can get one if you know how to row-reduce.
</p>
</annoacro>
<annoacro type="theorem" acro="NPNT">
<p>
This theorem is a fundamental tool for proving subsequent important theorems, such as <acroref type="theorem" acro="NI" />.  It may also be the best explantion for the term <q>nonsingular.</q>
</p>
</annoacro>
<annoacro type="theorem" acro="NI">
<p>
<q>Nonsingularity</q> or <q>invertibility</q>?  Pick your favorite, or show your versatility by using one or the other in the right context.  They mean the same thing.
</p>

<annoacro type="theorem" acro="CSCS">
<p>
Given a coefficient matrix, which vectors of constants create consistent systems.  This theorem tells us that the answer is exactly those column vectors in the column space.  Conversely, we also use this teorem to test for membership in the column space by checking the consistency of the appropriate system of equations.
</p>
</annoacro>
<annoacro type="theorem" acro="BCS">
<p>
Another theorem that provides a linearly independent set of vectors whose span equals some set of interest (a column space this time).
</p>
</annoacro>
<annoacro type="theorem" acro="BRS">
<p>
Yet another theorem that provides a linearly independent set of vectors whose span equals some set of interest (a row space).
</p>
</annoacro>
<annoacro type="theorem" acro="CSRST">
<p>
Column spaces, row spaces, transposes, rows, columns.  Many of the connections between these objects are based on the simple observation captured in this theorem.  This is not a deep result.  We state it as a theorem for convenience, so we can refer to it as needed.
</p>
</annoacro>
<annoacro type="theorem" acro="FS">
<p>
This theorem is inherently interesting, if not computationally satisfying.  Null space, row space, column space, left null space <mdash /> here they all are, simply by row reducing the extended matrix and applying <acroref type="theorem" acro="BNS" /> and <acroref type="theorem" acro="BCS" /> twice (each).  Nice.
